Magpie ships with a handful of effects that can be used in combinations. Most of the effects have parameters that can be customized. All effects are stored in the `effects` folder. You can easily add effects if you are familiar with HLSL. Check the [MagpieFX](https://github.com/Blinue/Magpie/wiki/MagpieFX%20(EN)) page.
